# Data-Mining
This repository contains my solutions to assignments from Data Mining course, implementing various machine learning algorithms and text classification techniques.

## ðŸ“‹ Assignments

### HW0: Data Processing & TFIDF Implementation
- **Task**: Implement TFIDF calculation from scratch for news article classification
- **Dataset**: 1000 news articles across 5 categories (sport, business, politics, entertainment, tech)
- **Implementation**: 
  - Text preprocessing (lowercase, punctuation removal, tokenization, stemming)
  - Manual TFIDF matrix computation (1000x1000)
  - Top 3 frequent words and highest TFIDF words per category
- **Deliverables**: Jupyter notebook, TFIDF matrix file, frequency/scores JSON files

### HW1: Tree-Based Classification Models
- **Task**: Implement and evaluate decision trees, random forests, and boosting models
- **Dataset**: News classification (1000 training articles, 681 test articles)
- **Models**: Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting
- **Evaluation**: 5-fold cross-validation with parameter tuning (criterion, min_samples_leaf, max_features, n_estimators)
- **Deliverables**: Code notebook, results description, predicted labels CSV

### HW2: Neural Networks & Feature Engineering
